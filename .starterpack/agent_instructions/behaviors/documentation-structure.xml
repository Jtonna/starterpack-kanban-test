  <summary>
    Documentation model defining file layouts and principles for single-project
    and monorepo setups — where docs live and how they should be organized.

    <principle>README references INDEX — README is the public face, INDEX is the internal map</principle>
    <principle>INDEX always exists and is complete — every doc file must be linked from INDEX</principle>
    <principle>ARCHITECTURE is always present — even a brief overview of the system design</principle>
    <principle>Think in services and systems — organize docs by what the code does, not by file tree</principle>
    <principle>Not extensive — keep docs concise and scannable, not exhaustive</principle>
