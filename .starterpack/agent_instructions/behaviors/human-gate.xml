<behavior name="human-gate">

  <summary>
    Defines what a human gate is and how to present information for human approval.
  </summary>

  <definition>
    A HUMAN_GATE is a hard block. The orchestrator MUST stop and wait
    for explicit human approval before proceeding. No assumptions. No skipping.
    The human's decision is final — approve, reject with feedback, or abort.

  <section name="protocol">
    <rule order="1">Present the gate summary to the human.</rule>
    <rule order="2">Clearly state: "BLOCKED — waiting for your approval to proceed."</rule>
    <rule order="3">Wait for human response. Do not take any action until they respond.</rule>
    <rule order="4">
      On APPROVE: proceed with the work that was pending approval.
      On REJECT: pass feedback to the relevant agents and loop back to revise.
      On ABORT: stop entirely, report status, and preserve all work done so far.
