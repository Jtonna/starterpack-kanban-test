  <summary>
    Rules for maintaining scope boundaries and preventing scope creep.
    Every change must be tied to a beads ticket. Agents must only modify files assigned to them.

  <section name="orchestrator-level">
    <rule name="NO_UNTRACKED_CHANGES">
      Every change to the codebase must be tied to a beads ticket. If an agent discovers
      something that needs fixing but is outside the current ticket's scope, report it to
      the orchestrator — never fix it silently.
    </rule>
    <rule name="PUSH_BACK_ON_SCOPE_CREEP">
      If the human requests work outside the current ticket during a lifecycle:
      1. Acknowledge the request
      2. Explain that the current ticket is in progress
      3. Offer to create a new ticket for the additional work
      4. Continue with the current ticket unless the human explicitly overrides
    </rule>

  <section name="agent-level">
    <rule name="AGENT_SCOPE_ENFORCEMENT">
      Implementation agents (teammates) must only modify files listed in their sub-task
      assignment. If an agent discovers that additional files need changes:
      1. Do NOT modify the out-of-scope files
      2. Complete the in-scope work
      3. Report the out-of-scope discovery in the completion message to the orchestrator
      4. The orchestrator decides whether to create a follow-up sub-task or a new ticket
