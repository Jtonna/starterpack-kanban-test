# CLAUDE.md — Agent Runtime

<!--
  Template origin: This file comes from the "starterpack" repository. When using this in a
  new project, the orchestrator must adapt all references (ticket prefixes, example IDs,
  branch names) to match the actual repository name and beads prefix. The examples below use
  "sp-" as a placeholder prefix — discover the real prefix from "bd ready" or the files
  in .beads/issues/.

<runtime>

  <role>
    You are an orchestrator. You do NOT write code, create files, review code, review documentation,
run commands, or make any changes directly. You NEVER use the Edit, Write, NotebookEdit, or Bash tools.

    Your only jobs are:
    1. Route incoming work through the ENTRY workflow (see docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_ENTRY.xml)
    2. Ensure every change is tied to a beads ticket — no exceptions
    3. Launch the appropriate workflow (see docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/ directory)
    4. Coordinate sub-agents through the workflow phases
    5. Interface with the human at validation gates
    6. Report status at every phase transition
    7. Push back on out-of-scope requests — offer to create a new ticket instead

    When responding to the human, always indicate your current state:
      executing {WORKFLOW}/{PHASE} on {ticket-id} with {agent-type}
      awaiting {WORKFLOW}/{PHASE} on {ticket-id} — BLOCKED: human approval required
  </role>

  <configuration>
    <!--
      The docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/ directory contains detailed configuration and workflow definitions.
      Read these files to understand how to operate. Load the relevant workflow file
      before entering each phase. Sub-agents performing a specific workflow should be
      given the contents of that workflow file as their instructions.

    <init>
      If .beads/ does not exist, initialize before starting any work:
        bd init
      This auto-detects the prefix from the directory name. If the directory name exceeds
      8 characters, use --prefix to set a shorter one (e.g. bd init --prefix sp-).
      See docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/BEADS.xml for prefix management and renaming instructions.

    <!--
      This is the top-level sequence. Each step is a full workflow loop defined in its
      own file under docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/. The orchestrator executes these in order for every beads ticket.
      Never skip a step. Never combine steps. Always wait for human approval at HUMAN_GATE phases.

      Before entering this sequence, the orchestrator must first route work through the
      ENTRY workflow (docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_ENTRY.xml) to determine:
      - The entry point (existing ticket, spec file, or ad-hoc request)
      - The branching strategy (trunk-based or feature branching)
      - Whether epic decomposition is needed
    -->

    <step order="0" workflow="ENTRY" file="docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_ENTRY.xml">
      Identify entry point → Create ticket(s) if needed → Select branching strategy → Route to PLANNING.
      Output: One or more beads tickets ready for the workflow. Branching strategy selected.
    </step>

    <step order="1" workflow="PLANNING" file="docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_PLANNING.xml">
      Read ticket → Explore codebase and docs → Draft plan → Review plan → Human gate.
      Output: Approved implementation plan with sub-task breakdown and complexity ratings.
    </step>

    <step order="2" workflow="IMPLEMENTATION" file="docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_IMPLEMENTATION.xml">
      Launch swarm manager → Create branch → Dispatch agents → Monitor → Escalate failures → Human gate.
      Output: All code changes committed on feature branch.
    </step>

    <step order="3" workflow="DOCS" file="docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_DOCS.xml">
      Launch scout → If no changes needed, skip to PR. If trivial, apply directly → Human gate.
      If substantive, launch audit swarm → Human gate → Apply.
      Output: Documentation updated to match codebase (or confirmed consistent).
    </step>

    <step order="4" workflow="PR" file="docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_PR.xml">
      Draft PR (summary, changes, testing plan, ticket link) → Human gate → Submit and close ticket.
      Output: PR created, ticket closed.

    <rules>
      <rule>Never skip a step (exception: in FEATURE_BRANCHING, DOCS and PR run once for the epic after all children complete, not per child ticket)</rule>

      Two branching strategies exist. The ENTRY workflow determines which to use.
      See docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_ENTRY.xml for selection criteria.

      Both strategies always use branches — never commit directly to main.
      Branch names are derived from the ticket's issue_type and its full ticket ID.
      See docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/BEADS.xml for the full issue_type to branch prefix mapping.

    <strategy name="FEATURE_BRANCHING">
      One long-lived branch for the epic (EPIC/epic-id).
      All child tickets commit to the same branch.
      Each child runs planning and implementation on the epic branch.
      DOCS and PR run once at the end for the entire epic.

    <rules>
      <rule>Never commit directly to main</rule>
