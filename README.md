# starterpack-kanban-test

Test repo for validating the [starterpack](https://github.com/Jtonna/starterpack) orchestrator workflow.

The goal is to install the starterpack into this repo and use the full workflow (planning, implementation, docs, PR) to build a basic kanban app from the spec in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

This is not a real product. It exists to exercise and stress-test the starterpack workflow end-to-end.
