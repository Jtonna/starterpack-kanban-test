  <overview>
    This file defines which models to use for each agent role. The orchestrator reads this
    file to determine model assignments. These are defaults — the orchestrator may escalate
    to a higher-tier model when a lower-tier agent fails or encounters complexity beyond
    its capability. The planner's complexity rating can also override the default tier at
    dispatch time (see dispatch-override section).
  </overview>

  <tiers>
    <tier name="reasoning" model="opus">
      Planning, review, debugging, escalation, team coordination.
    </tier>
    <tier name="worker" model="sonnet">
      Standard implementation tasks.
    </tier>
    <tier name="light" model="haiku">
      Simple/mechanical implementation — renames, moves, boilerplate, admin operations.
    </tier>
  </tiers>

  <roles>
    <role name="orchestrator" tier="reasoning" escalates-to="none">
      Never writes code, documentation, or runs commands. Human interface and workflow
      coordinator only. Launches sub-agents and manages workflow progression.
      During IMPLEMENTATION, acts as Agent Team lead: creates branches, spawns
      implementation teammates, monitors progress, and handles escalation directly.
    </role>
    <role name="explorer" tier="reasoning" escalates-to="none">
      Explores codebase and project documentation to build context for planning.
      Reads code AND docs, but treats code as the source of truth — docs may be outdated.
      When docs contradict code, flags the discrepancy in the context report.
      Read-only — never writes code or documentation.
    </role>
    <role name="planner" tier="reasoning" escalates-to="none">
      Drafts implementation plans from tickets. Assigns complexity ratings
      (light / standard / complex) per sub-task that determine model tier at dispatch.
    </role>
    <role name="plan-reviewer" tier="reasoning" escalates-to="none">
      Reviews plans, raises questions to human via orchestrator.
    </role>
    <role name="implementer" tier="worker" escalates-to="reasoning">
      Writes code. Escalates on failure after 1 retry. See escalation-rules for the
      full failure protocol that must be included in agent instructions.
    </role>
    <role name="light-implementer" tier="light" escalates-to="worker,reasoning">
      Boilerplate, renames, simple edits. Escalates on any failure.
    </role>
    <role name="doc-scout" tier="reasoning" escalates-to="none">
      Reviews git changes against existing documentation to determine if updates are needed.
      Triages: no changes, trivial fix, or full audit required.
      Read-only — never writes code or documentation.
    </role>
    <role name="doc-auditor" tier="reasoning" escalates-to="none">
      Performs deep per-file documentation audit. Produces structured findings with
      severity ratings and suggested fixes. Read-only — never writes.
    </role>
    <role name="doc-writer" tier="worker" escalates-to="orchestrator">
      Applies approved documentation updates. Only modifies documentation files.
      Operates in the DOCS workflow — failures escalate directly to the orchestrator.
    </role>
    <role name="pr-drafter" tier="reasoning" escalates-to="none">
      Compiles commits and diffs to draft pull request title, summary, changes table,
      and AI suggested testing plan. Read-only — never writes code or documentation.
    </role>
    <role name="submitter" tier="light" escalates-to="orchestrator">
      Performs administrative git and GitHub operations: push branches, create PRs via gh,
      close beads tickets. No code or documentation changes. Operates in the PR workflow
      — failures escalate directly to the orchestrator.
    </role>
  </roles>

  <dispatch-override>
    The planner assigns a complexity rating to each sub-task during the PLANNING workflow.
    The orchestrator (team lead) uses this rating to select the model tier for each implementation teammate at dispatch:

    <complexity rating="light" dispatches-at="light">
      Haiku. Boilerplate, renames, simple mechanical edits.
    </complexity>
    <complexity rating="standard" dispatches-at="worker">
      Sonnet. Normal implementation work.
    </complexity>
    <complexity rating="complex" dispatches-at="reasoning">
      Opus. Known-complex sub-tasks that would likely fail and escalate anyway.
    </complexity>

    The escalation path still applies regardless of starting tier. A complex task dispatched
    at reasoning that fails will escalate to the orchestrator for human guidance.
  </dispatch-override>

  <escalation-rules>
    <!--
      Note: "escalates-to" on roles refers to MODEL-TIER escalation (upgrading to a more
      capable model). WORKFLOW-LEVEL escalation (reporting to orchestrator/human) is a
      separate concept — all agents can escalate to the orchestrator regardless of their
      "escalates-to" setting.

        - Requirements failures (impossible plan, unclear spec, wrong direction): the human is
          asked for clarification or course correction.

  <overrides>
    To change model assignments for a specific project, edit the roles section above.
    For example, a budget-conscious project might set implementer to light tier with
    escalation to worker then reasoning.

      The IMPLEMENTATION workflow uses Claude Code Agent Teams (experimental).
      This feature MUST be enabled in the project's Claude Code settings:
        { "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" } }

      Key constraints:
      - Sub-agents (Task tool) cannot spawn other sub-agents
      - Only the team lead (orchestrator) can spawn teammates
      - Teammates cannot spawn their own teams or sub-agents
      - The implementation phase is the ONLY workflow that uses Agent Teams
      - All other phases (planning, docs, PR) use standard sub-agents via the Task tool
